## Election Audit Summary
The election_data.csv file was quite large at 369,712 rows of data. Using Python and VS Code to analyze the data, I was able to use dictionaries, conditionals and for loops to count the votes by county and candidate; calculate the percentage of votes by county and candidate; and determine the winner.

The election audit summary results can be used by the Colorado Board of Election to allocate resources as needed/desired per voter turnout.
