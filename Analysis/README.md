## Challenge Overview
The election_data.csv file was quite large at 369,712 rows of data. Using the software listed in resources I was able to use a for loop to count the votes by candidate, calculate the percentage of votes by candidate and determine the winner. 

## Challenge Summary
To analyze the data and write the results to a text file, I needed to: import 'csv' and 'os' modules; write code to read the csv file; create variables; write for loops and nested for loops along with using dictionaries, indexing and formatting to present the analysis in a user-friendly format.
