# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has provided me the following tasks to complete an audit of a recent Congressional election.
Tasks Include:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of the candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

## Resources
 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 - Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code 1.65.2

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
-There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
-The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
-The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the votes and 85,213 number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The election_data.csv file was quite large at 369,712 rows of data. Using the software listed in resources I was able to carefully count the votes by candidate, calculate the percentage of votes by candidate and determine the winner. 

## Challenge Summary
To analyze the data and write the results to a text file, I needed to: import 'csv' and 'os' modules; write code to read the csv file; create variables; write for loops and nested for loops along with using dictionaries, indexing and formatting to present the analysis in a user-friendly format.
